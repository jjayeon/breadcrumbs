<h6>Inspiration</h6>
<p>Breadcrumbs was inspired by Langton's Ant, a cellular automaton in the form of an ant navigating through a grid based on a simple set of rules. The ant turns left or right depending on whether the current tile is white or black. By allowing the player to change the flip the colour of the tiles, the path of the ant can be changed. <strong><em>The objective of the game is to guide the ant from one corner of the grid to the opposite corner, avoiding obstacles.</em></strong></p>
